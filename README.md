# üõ†Ô∏è On-Chain Portfolio Project: ETH-BUILDERS-DAY-DEMO

Welcome to the **On-Chain Portfolio Project** repository :)

This initiative is part of the ETH Builder's Day by **Bhopal DAO**, where 40 talented builders came together to create and deploy fully functional **on-chain portfolios**.

If you're here, you're likely one of these builders. It's time to **open source your portfolio project** and share it with the world! This README will walk you through the process step-by-step.
